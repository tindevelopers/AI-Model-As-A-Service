# This .dockerignore file is no longer needed for Vercel deployment
# 
# The deployment has been migrated from Google Cloud Run to Vercel
# Vercel uses .vercelignore for similar functionality if needed
#
# If you need to deploy to a containerized environment in the future,
# you can restore this file from the git history.
