# This Dockerfile is no longer needed for Vercel deployment
# 
# The deployment has been migrated from Google Cloud Run to Vercel
# Vercel handles the build and deployment process automatically
# without requiring Docker containers.
#
# If you need to deploy to a containerized environment in the future,
# you can restore this file from the git history.
