# This Cloud Run service configuration is no longer needed for Vercel deployment
# 
# The deployment has been migrated from Google Cloud Run to Vercel
# Vercel handles service configuration automatically
#
# If you need to deploy to Google Cloud Run in the future,
# you can restore this file from the git history.
