# GitHub Secrets Configured

All required GitHub secrets have been set up for CI/CD deployment:
- GCP_PROJECT_ID: Google Cloud project ID
- GCP_SA_KEY: Service account credentials for deployment
- SECRET_KEY: Application secret key
- OPENAI_API_KEY: OpenAI API access (placeholder - replace with real key)
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: Anthropic API access (placeholder - replace with real key)  
- GOOGLE_API_KEY: Google API access (placeholder - replace with real key)

⚠️ **Important**: Replace the placeholder API keys with your actual keys for production deployment.

# Google Cloud APIs Enabled

The following APIs have been enabled for the project:
- Artifact Registry API (artifactregistry.googleapis.com)
- Cloud Run API (run.googleapis.com) 
- Cloud Build API (cloudbuild.googleapis.com)

This resolves the deployment failure where Docker images couldn't be pushed to Google Container Registry.

# IAM Permissions Updated

Additional IAM permissions granted to service account:
- roles/artifactregistry.writer - For pushing Docker images to Artifact Registry
- roles/storage.objectAdmin - For Google Container Registry access

This resolves the permission error: 'artifactregistry.repositories.uploadArtifacts denied'

# Repository Creation Permission Added

Additional IAM permission granted to service account:
- roles/artifactregistry.repoAdmin - Allows automatic repository creation on push

This resolves the error: 'gcr.io repo does not exist. Creating on push requires the artifactregistry.repositories.createOnPush permission'

The service account now has full permissions to:
- Create repositories automatically when pushing Docker images
- Write to existing repositories  
- Manage repository settings

# Docker Repository Created

Pre-created the Docker repository to resolve the createOnPush permission issue:
- Repository: ai-gateway
- Format: docker  
- Location: us
- Project: endless-station-471909-a8

This bypasses the need for artifactregistry.repositories.createOnPush permission during deployment.

# Cloud Run IAM Permissions Added

Additional IAM permissions granted to service account for Cloud Run deployment:
- roles/iam.serviceAccountUser - Allows acting as other service accounts
- roles/run.developer - Full Cloud Run deployment permissions

This resolves the error: 'Permission iam.serviceaccounts.actAs denied on service account'

The service account now has complete permissions for:
- Docker image building and pushing to Artifact Registry
- Cloud Run service deployment and management
- Acting as the default Compute Engine service account
