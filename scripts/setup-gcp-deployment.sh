# This script is no longer needed for Vercel deployment
# 
# The deployment has been migrated from Google Cloud Run to Vercel
# Vercel handles deployment automatically through Git integration
#
# For Vercel setup, please refer to DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
# or use the Vercel CLI: npm i -g vercel && vercel
#
# If you need to deploy to Google Cloud Run in the future,
# you can restore this file from the git history.
