# Vercel Deployment Configuration Fix

## 🚨 Current Problem
The `develop` branch is deploying to production, which is incorrect. We need to fix the branch-to-environment mapping.

## ✅ Correct Configuration Should Be:
- **`main` branch** → **Production** (ai-maas-production.tinconnect.com)
- **`staging` branch** → **Staging Environment**
- **`develop` branch** → **Development/Preview Only** (no production deployment)

## 🔧 Manual Fix Required (Vercel Web Dashboard)

### Step 1: Access Vercel Project Settings
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/tindeveloper/ai-model-as-a-service/settings/git
2. Login to your Vercel account if needed

### Step 2: Configure Branch Deployment Settings
1. **Production Branch**: Set to `main` only
2. **Preview Branches**: Set to `staging`, `develop` (optional)
3. **Ignore Build Step**: Configure to prevent `develop` from deploying to production

### Step 3: Configure Deployment Protection
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/tindeveloper/ai-model-as-a-service/settings/deployment-protection
2. Enable deployment protection for production branch (`main`)
3. Configure to require manual approval for production deployments

## 🚀 Alternative Solution: Use GitHub Actions Only

Since we have GitHub Actions properly configured, we can:
1. Keep Vercel Git integration disabled for automatic deployments
2. Use GitHub Actions to trigger Vercel deployments manually
3. This gives us full control over when and what gets deployed

## 📋 Verification Steps

### After Configuration:
1. Push to `develop` branch → Should create preview deployment only
2. Push to `staging` branch → Should create staging deployment
3. Push to `main` branch → Should create production deployment
4. Create PR → Should create preview deployment

### Check Deployment URLs:
- **Production**: https://ai-maas-production.tinconnect.com
- **Staging**: https://ai-model-as-a-service-staging.vercel.app
- **Preview**: https://ai-model-as-a-service-[branch].vercel.app

## 🔍 Current Status
- ✅ GitHub Actions properly configured
- ✅ Branch protection rules in place
- ⚠️ Vercel Git integration needs manual configuration
- ⚠️ Branch deployment settings need adjustment

## 📝 Next Steps
1. Configure Vercel web dashboard settings (manual)
2. Test deployment from each branch
3. Verify correct environment targeting
4. Update documentation with final configuration
