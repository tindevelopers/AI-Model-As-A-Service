# Deployment Trigger

This file is used to trigger a new deployment to ensure the restored signin functionality gets deployed.

## Current Status
- ✅ SignInForm component is fully restored
- ✅ Context providers are working
- ✅ Local build is successful
- ❌ Deployment is showing old disabled version

## What's Fixed
1. **SignInForm**: Full authentication form with email/password fields
2. **Context Providers**: AuthProvider, TenantProvider, SidebarProvider, ThemeProvider
3. **Assets**: auth-logo.svg and grid-01.svg are available in public/images/
4. **Routing**: Proper signin page routing restored

## Expected Result
The deployed signin page should show:
- Full signin form with email and password fields
- Working authentication functionality
- Proper logo and grid assets loading
- No "temporarily disabled" message
